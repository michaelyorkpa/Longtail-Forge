## Version 0.33.4 - Shopping / Procurement Lists Module

- [ ] Treat this as an official first-party module. 
  - [ ] The module should ship with Longtail Forge. 
  - [ ] It should be enable/disable capable per workspace.
  - [ ] Personal/family workspaces should label it as "Shopping Lists." 
  - [ ] Business workspaces should label it as "Procurement Lists."
  - [ ] The underlying module ID should remain stable regardless of label.
  - [ ] Suggested module ID: `lists`.

- [ ] Add optional first-party lists module for personal/family and business workspaces.
- [ ] Use workspace-aware labels:
  - [ ] Personal/family workspaces: "Shopping Lists"
  - [ ] Business workspaces: "Procurement Lists"
- [ ] Core list fields:
  - [ ] `list_id`

- [ ] Integrations:
  - [ ] Lists should support tags once tagging is stable.
  - [ ] Lists should be searchable once framework search is stable.
  - [ ] List activity should be able to appear in dashboard/activity feed later.

## Version 0.33.5.0 - Task Module QoL Updates

### Parent/Child Tasks

- [ ] Add parent/child task relationships
  - [ ] Prevent circular references
  - [ ] Parent tasks can be part of different projects
    - Should this be an adjustable setting within the workspace? Should you only be allowed to pull from the same project/client for parent tasks? I can see this being a useful setting, but I'm open to ideas.

### Task Checklists

Decision: Task checklists are lightweight completion aids inside a task. Full subtasks are separate task records and should be deferred until the Tasks module needs parent-child task planning, dependencies, or nested assignment workflows.

- [ ] Add lightweight checklist support to Tasks.
  - [ ] Checklist items belong to a single task.
  - [ ] Checklist items are not full subtasks.
  - [ ] Checklist items should support:
    - [ ] Checklist item ID
    - [ ] Workspace ID
    - [ ] Task ID
    - [ ] Label/title
    - [ ] Checked/completed state
    - [ ] Completed at
    - [ ] Completed by user ID
    - [ ] Sort order
    - [ ] Created at
    - [ ] Updated at
  - [ ] Allow permitted users to add, edit, reorder, check, uncheck, and delete checklist items.
  - [ ] Display checklist progress on the task detail view.
    - [ ] Example: `3 / 7 complete`
  - [ ] Optionally show checklist progress on task cards/list rows after the task UI is cleaned up.
  - [ ] Do not make checklist items separately taggable in the first pass.
  - [ ] Do not make checklist items separately assignable in the first pass.
  - [ ] Do not attach timers directly to checklist items in the first pass.
  - [ ] Do not treat checklist items as dependencies or project schedule records.
  - [ ] Leave full subtasks/parent-child tasks as future work.

### Task Metadata Update

- [ ] Inside the task details, completed and archived tasks should display "Time to completion" which is calculated from created date/time and completed date/time

- [ ] Add progress/completion information
  - Stand alone tasks
    - Use status as task completion tracker

### Task UI

In Projects -> Tasks, the task list isn't optimized for efficient viewing.
- [ ] Create a three row listing for each task
  - [ ] Row one is the task name with tag chips below
  - [ ] Row two is the rest of the meta data
    - [ ] Truncate Scope/Assignees harder on mobile
  - [ ] Row three is the buttons, right aligned
    - The icon buttons are great, except for the "Follow Notifications" button, this should be a bell

## Version 0.33.5.2 - Reporting, Clients and Projects, and API QoL Update

### Reporting

- For proper calculation, each sub project must total all time entries and round to the nearest
  - Parent projects should then take that total and add it to sum of all sub project time entries
  - This will produce a sub-client total which can then be added to parent client totals

- Reporting -> Time Reports
  - Hide Start Date and End Date until billing period is is Custom
    - Alternately, update Start Date and End Date based on Billing Period Selection

### Sorting logic for clients and projects

- Move logic for sorting of clients to the clients module and have that called every time clients are listed somewhere
- Move logic for sorting of projects to the projects module and have that called every time clients are listed somewhere

### API Keys

- Audit the API keys available
  - It doesn't appear that I'm seeing the correct API Keys for workspace admin account. Here's what shows:
    - clients:read
    - projects:read
    - tasks:read
    - tasks:write
    - time_entries:read
    - time_entries:write
  - There's nothing for files, search, notes or anything else in there. And there's no write for clients or projects

## Version 0.33.5.4 - Files and Time Tracking QoL Updates

### Files module

- There's no way to delete files??
- Multiple file upload at once
- Drag and Drop file upload

- Need to have a way to limit file uploads, per workspace and per user
  - This would be quantity/size limits
  - This would be file types

### Time Entries

- Time entries aren't editable by Workspace admin
  - Tried to add tags as workspace admin to "81c61ec4-ebe4-45c2-a35d-b03e88b45bb9" and got a permissions error (couldn't read the whole thing, it was on the main window and the modal window blocked it)
  - Had to log in as Super Admin to add tags

- Are time entries from timers storing the actual start and end time with an unconnected duration, or are they adjusting start or end time based on total duration?
  - It should be the former. I want to see exactly when a timer was started and ended, as well as the total duration the timer was running during that period. Start and End time are informational, not anything to be calculated.

## Version 0.33.5.6 - Search, Notification, and Tag QoL Updates

### Search Fixes/Tweaks

- Help is in the record types twice

### Notification Fixes/Tweaks

- Users who perform the action, don't need notifications of the action happening, e.g.
  - Creators of records don't need {{recordType}} created notifications
  - Modifiers of records don't need {{recordType}} updated notifications

- [ ] notifications.html: Notification Type chip should be aligned to right, in board from "Dismissed"

- [ ] Record update notifications should include the changed context human-formatted from the JSON data

- [ ] Create Notification grouping
  - [ ] Notifications in Business workspaces should be grouped by Client
  - [ ] Notifications in Personal/Family workspaces should be grouped by Project

- [ ] Notifications should display a truncated plain English explanation of what changed for things like:
  - Description added
  - Task updated
  - etc.

- [ ] All Notifications Page -> Notification type chip is floating weird, it should be anchored just left of the Unread/Read/Dismissed chip

- "Urgent" priority notifications should turn the bell icon red and, optionally, show an in-app alert modal
- "High" priority notifications should turn the bell icon red and not be grouped
- "Normal" priority should be grouped and increment the number on the bell icon
- "Low" priority should be grouped and NOT increase the number on the bell icon

### Tags Fixes/Tweaks

- [ ] Anywhere there's a Tag filter, add a "No Tags" option to easily identify items that still need to be tagged
  - Should be directly below "All tags" option

- Tags should be bulk assignable/removable in the following contexts:
  - Projects -> Time Keeping -> Time Entries
    - This will require checkboxes in a tight leftmost column for this display to enable bulk editing
  - Projects -> Tasks
  - Eventually, Projects -> Notes
  - Bulk tag application should use the same/similar box to initial entry
    - This entire thing should be owned within tags and be hooked in via the framework, not hard coded anywhere

- [ ] Add tag chips between task title and task meta data on Workbench; keep it tight

## Version 0.33.5.8 - Client/Projects Fixes/Tweaks

### Client/Projects Fixes/Tweaks

- Projects aren't inheriting client billing settings when created in Projects -> Project Settings -> Add Project

- Saving Client billing settings wipes out client tags
  - Specific path I Took was:
    - Settings -> Workspace -> Clients -> Add Client button
      - Added the client and tags
    - Edited the client to turn off billing and turn on rounding
    - Saved client
    - Tags gone
    - Re-adding tags through Edit Client modal worked

## Version 0.33.5.9 - Notes Type Cleanup

## Notes Type Cleanup

- [ ] Reframe `note_type` as content kind, not linked-record context.
- [ ] Keep the database column name `note_type` for compatibility.
- [ ] Change the user-facing label to "Note Kind" or "Content Type".
- [ ] Keep initial content-kind values small:
  - `general`
  - `meeting`
  - `research`
  - `decision`
  - `procedure`
  - `reference`
  - `idea`
  - `log`
- [ ] Stop offering `client`, `project`, `task`, `ticket`, and `user` as new note type choices.
- [ ] Preserve legacy values in existing records and display them safely.
- [ ] Do not migrate existing rows yet unless the implementation already needs a migration.
- [ ] Use linked context and `note_links` for client/project/task/user/ticket association.
- [ ] Add regression coverage that `note_type` does not control permissions, visibility, Library bucket, collection membership, or KB publication.

## Version 0.33.5.10 - Glaring Holes Patched

### Notes Linked Record Usability

* [ ] Replace raw linked-context ID entry in Notes with a permission-safe record picker.

  * [ ] Users should be able to search/select supported link targets instead of pasting IDs.
  * [ ] Supported initial targets:

    * [ ] Workspace
    * [ ] Client
    * [ ] Project
    * [ ] Task
    * [ ] User
  * [ ] Ticket should remain reserved until the Tickets module exists.
  * [ ] Picker results must respect workspace, module state, target read permissions, and record visibility.
  * [ ] Picker results should show human labels, not only UUIDs.
  * [ ] Selecting a task should optionally infer project/client context where safe.
  * [ ] Linking a note to a task should suggest the Active Work Library bucket.
  * [ ] Linking a note to a client/project/user should suggest Ongoing Areas unless the user manually overrides the Library bucket.
  * [ ] Linking behavior must not grant note access or target-record access by itself.

* [ ] Add a reusable Notes linked-record panel/helper.

  * [ ] This should be owned by the Notes module and mounted by other modules where appropriate.
  * [ ] Inputs:

    * [ ] `targetType`
    * [ ] `targetId`
    * [ ] `clientId` optional
    * [ ] `projectId` optional
    * [ ] `readonly` optional
  * [ ] The helper should list notes linked by direct context columns and flexible `note_links` rows.
  * [ ] The helper should support:

    * [ ] View linked notes.
    * [ ] Create note for current record.
    * [ ] Link existing note.
    * [ ] Unlink note where permitted.
    * [ ] Show note visibility/security/status badges.
    * [ ] Hide private/secure/inaccessible notes without leaking counts or titles.
  * [ ] The helper should use `/api/notes/for-target` or a successor route rather than duplicating note lookup logic inside Tasks, Clients, Projects, or future Tickets.

### Task Notes Integration

* [ ] Add a Notes panel to the Task detail dialog.

  * [ ] Show notes linked to the current task.
  * [ ] Show a clear empty state: “No notes linked to this task.”
  * [ ] Allow permitted users to create a note from the task.
  * [ ] New task-created notes should:

    * [ ] Set `task_id`.
    * [ ] Set `project_id` and `client_id` from the task where available.
    * [ ] Default Library bucket to Active Work.
    * [ ] Default note type to `task`.
    * [ ] Default visibility to `internal` unless the user chooses otherwise.
  * [ ] Allow permitted users to link an existing note to the task.
  * [ ] Allow permitted users to unlink a note from the task.
  * [ ] Do not show the panel for unsaved tasks except for a “Save the task before adding notes” state.

* [ ] Add linked-note indicators to task list rows/cards after the current task-list UI cleanup.

  * [ ] Show a compact note count where permitted.
  * [ ] Do not leak inaccessible note counts.
  * [ ] Clicking the count should open the task detail dialog and focus the Notes panel.

### Notes Display Improvements

* [ ] Replace raw linked context values in Note detail with human-readable links.

  * [ ] Client name instead of client ID.
  * [ ] Project name instead of project ID.
  * [ ] Task title instead of task ID.
  * [ ] User display name/email where allowed.
  * [ ] Fall back to safe ID display only when the target label cannot be read.

* [ ] Add linked-record navigation from Note detail.

  * [ ] Client/project/task/user links should open the appropriate record view where available.
  * [ ] Missing or inaccessible records should show a safe unavailable state.

### Regressions

* [ ] Notes target picker only returns records the user can read.
* [ ] Task-linked notes appear in the task Notes panel when linked through `task_id`.
* [ ] Task-linked notes appear in the task Notes panel when linked through `note_links`.
* [ ] Creating a note from a task sets task/project/client context safely.
* [ ] Private notes do not appear to unauthorized users in linked-note panels.
* [ ] Secure note bodies and previews do not appear in linked-note panels.
* [ ] Linked-note counts do not leak inaccessible notes.
* [ ] Archived notes are read-only from embedded panels.
* [ ] Disabled Notes module blocks new note/link writes but preserves historical reads where allowed.

## Version 0.33.5.12 - Help Center Re-work

- Need a way to edit and expand the help center records
  - Can we create an editor, only for me? It doesn't need to be fancy, just basic markdown/wiki links and a way to edit the content that's already there

- Getting Started should explain the key concepts that make LTF unique and how they're all inter-linked

## Knowledge Base Direction Adjustment

Decision:
Knowledge Base is the reviewed, read-only knowledge layer generated from Notes first. Notes remain the working authoring records. Knowledge Base entries may still be written directly, but the default workflow is note-sourced: normal internal/workspace/client-visible notes become KB review candidates automatically, then reviewers approve and publish safe read-only KB snapshots.

### Add to 0.34.1 - Knowledge Base Module Contract, Publishing Model, and Notes Relationship

* [ ] Define Knowledge Base as the reviewed consumption layer for Notes-backed knowledge.

  * [ ] Notes are the working/source records.
  * [ ] KB articles are reviewed read-only article records or publication snapshots.
  * [ ] Normal note creation/update can automatically create or update a KB review candidate.
  * [ ] Automatic KB candidate creation does not mean automatic publishing.
  * [ ] Publishing remains explicit, permission-protected, audited, and snapshot-based.
  * [ ] KB may support directly authored articles, but direct authoring is secondary to note-sourced workflow.

* [ ] Add KB candidate/source behavior.

  * [ ] Add `source_mode` values:

    * [ ] `note_sourced`
    * [ ] `manual`
    * [ ] `imported`
  * [ ] Add `source_sync_state` or equivalent metadata:

    * [ ] `current`
    * [ ] `source_updated`
    * [ ] `manual_override`
    * [ ] `detached`
  * [ ] Add `source_note_id` convenience field only if it simplifies the common one-note article case; keep `kb_article_sources` as the canonical many-source table.
  * [ ] Add `source_note_revision_id` or use `kb_article_sources.source_revision_id` to preserve the note revision that seeded the reviewed article.
  * [ ] Add `last_source_synced_at`.
  * [ ] Add `last_reviewed_at`.
  * [ ] Add `review_due_at` optional for future maintenance workflows.

* [ ] Define automatic candidate rules.

  * [ ] Normal `internal` notes create internal KB candidates.
  * [ ] Normal `workspace` notes create workspace KB candidates.
  * [ ] Normal `client_visible` notes may create client-visible KB candidates only after client-visible KB permissions and file safety are enabled.
  * [ ] `private` notes do not create KB candidates by default.
  * [ ] `secure` notes must never create KB candidates.
  * [ ] Deleted notes should not create KB candidates.
  * [ ] Archived notes may remain as KB sources, but should not automatically update pending candidates unless explicitly configured.

* [ ] Define KB statuses for note-sourced workflow.

  * [ ] `draft`
  * [ ] `in_review`
  * [ ] `approved`
  * [ ] `published`
  * [ ] `rejected`
  * [ ] `archived`
  * [ ] `deleted`
  * [ ] Manually created articles start as `draft`.
  * [ ] Automatically note-sourced articles start as `in_review`.
  * [ ] Updating a source note marks the KB candidate/publication as `source_updated` or creates a new review revision, but does not silently mutate the published snapshot.
  * [ ] Rejected candidates remain linked to the source note for history unless deleted by a permitted user.

### Add to 0.34.2 - Knowledge Base Browser API, Editorial Workflow, and Internal UI MVP

* [ ] Add automatic note-to-KB candidate service methods.

  * [ ] Create or update candidate from note.
  * [ ] Queue note for KB review.
  * [ ] Read KB candidate by source note.
  * [ ] List KB candidates needing review.
  * [ ] Mark source update pending review.
  * [ ] Detach KB article from source note where permitted.
  * [ ] Reject KB candidate with reason.
  * [ ] Approve KB candidate.
  * [ ] Publish approved KB article snapshot.

* [ ] Add Notes lifecycle hook integration.

  * [ ] On normal note created, create KB candidate if workspace KB candidate policy allows it.
  * [ ] On normal note updated, mark linked KB candidate/publication as source-updated.
  * [ ] On note archived, preserve existing KB linkage but stop automatic updates unless configured.
  * [ ] On note deleted, hide or mark linked KB candidate as source unavailable.
  * [ ] Do not process secure notes.
  * [ ] Do not process private notes unless a future explicit rule allows it.

* [ ] Add KB review queue UI.

  * [ ] Show candidates grouped by source visibility:

    * [ ] Internal
    * [ ] Workspace
    * [ ] Client-visible when enabled
  * [ ] Show source note title, source collection path, source updated date, proposed article title, visibility, review status, and whether the source changed since last review.
  * [ ] Allow reviewers to approve, reject, edit article draft, publish, or detach.
  * [ ] Make it obvious when a published KB article is behind its source note.

### Add to 0.34.3 - Knowledge Base Search, Tags, Attachments, Static Pages, and Permission Boundaries

* [ ] Add KB article chrome/window-dressing generation.

  * [ ] Generate safe table of contents.
  * [ ] Generate “What links here.”
  * [ ] Generate related articles from article links, source notes, shared tags, shared collections, and wiki-style links.
  * [ ] Show source-note linkage only to users who can access the source note.
  * [ ] Show source update/review status only to internal users with review/history permission.
  * [ ] Hide internal source data from client-visible/public outputs.
  * [ ] Backlink lists must be permission-filtered and must not leak inaccessible article titles, note titles, files, or counts.

* [ ] Add KB link index support.

  * [ ] Track article-to-article links detected from Markdown/wiki-style links.
  * [ ] Track note-to-article references where useful.
  * [ ] Track source note-to-article relationships through `kb_article_sources`.
  * [ ] Rebuild link indexes when article Markdown, note wiki links, slugs, or source links change.
  * [ ] Broken links should be allowed but clearly labeled for reviewers.

### Add to 0.34.4 - Knowledge Base Settings, Documentation, and Closeout

* [ ] Add KB automation settings.

  * [ ] Configure note-to-KB candidate behavior:

    * [ ] Disabled
    * [ ] Manual only
    * [ ] Auto-create internal/workspace candidates
    * [ ] Auto-create client-visible candidates when supported
  * [ ] Configure default candidate status for note-sourced entries.
  * [ ] Configure whether review is always required before publishing.
  * [ ] Configure whether source note updates reopen review.
  * [ ] Configure whether archived notes can continue feeding KB candidates.
  * [ ] Settings must not bypass permissions, secure-note restrictions, private-note restrictions, file safety, or publication review.

## Version 0.35.0 - Support Tickets Framework Contract

* [ ] Add Support Tickets as a first-party workflow module.

  * [ ] Module ID should be `support-tickets`.
  * [ ] Tickets are workflow records, not framework/core records.
  * [ ] Tickets should use framework-owned services for users, workspaces, permissions, tags, search, notifications, audit logging, file attachments, events/hooks, API scopes, and module lifecycle.
  * [ ] Do not hard-code ticket behavior into framework-owned app shell, search, notification, file, or permission services.
  * [ ] Support Tickets should be disableable per workspace where appropriate.
  * [ ] Disabled ticket module should block new ticket writes while preserving historical reads if `historicalReadAccess` is enabled.

* [ ] Define ticket terminology by workspace type.

  * [ ] Business workspaces should display "Support Tickets" / "Tickets".
  * [ ] Personal and Family workspaces may display "Requests" where terminology is user-facing.
  * [ ] Terminology must be display-only.
  * [ ] Stored module IDs, route names, permission IDs, API scopes, audit record types, and database fields should remain stable.

* [ ] Define core ticket record model.

  * [ ] Add `tickets` table.
  * [ ] Suggested fields:

    * [ ] `ticket_id`
    * [ ] `workspace_id`
    * [ ] `ticket_number` or `display_key`
    * [ ] `client_id` optional
    * [ ] `project_id` optional
    * [ ] `requester_user_id` optional
    * [ ] `requester_name_snapshot`
    * [ ] `requester_email_snapshot`
    * [ ] `title`
    * [ ] `description`
    * [ ] `status`
    * [ ] `priority`
    * [ ] `category`
    * [ ] `source`
    * [ ] `visibility`
    * [ ] `assigned_user_id` optional
    * [ ] `created_by_user_id`
    * [ ] `created_at`
    * [ ] `updated_at`
    * [ ] `closed_at`
    * [ ] `archived_at`
    * [ ] `metadata_json`
  * [ ] Ticket records must always belong to one workspace.
  * [ ] Client/project links must belong to the same workspace as the ticket.
  * [ ] External/client-created tickets should snapshot requester name/email for historical context.

* [ ] Define ticket statuses.

  * [ ] Start with a small boring set:

    * [ ] `new`
    * [ ] `open`
    * [ ] `waiting_on_internal`
    * [ ] `waiting_on_client`
    * [ ] `resolved`
    * [ ] `closed`
    * [ ] `archived`
  * [ ] Keep status labels configurable/display-friendly later.
  * [ ] Do not make tags the source of truth for ticket status.

* [ ] Define ticket priorities.

  * [ ] Start with:

    * [ ] `low`
    * [ ] `normal`
    * [ ] `high`
    * [ ] `urgent`
  * [ ] Priority should be an explicit field.
  * [ ] Do not infer priority from tags.

* [ ] Define ticket sources.

  * [ ] Start with:

    * [ ] `internal`
    * [ ] `client_portal`
    * [ ] `public_api`
    * [ ] `import`
  * [ ] Reserve future source values:

    * [ ] `wordpress`
    * [ ] `shopify`
    * [ ] `email`
    * [ ] `webhook`
    * [ ] `automation`
  * [ ] Source should be metadata, not permission logic.

* [ ] Add ticket ledger foundation.

  * [ ] Add `ticket_entries` or `ticket_ledger_entries` table.
  * [ ] A ticket entry represents a visible ticket timeline item, not the security audit log.
  * [ ] Suggested fields:

    * [ ] `ticket_entry_id`
    * [ ] `workspace_id`
    * [ ] `ticket_id`
    * [ ] `entry_type`
    * [ ] `visibility`
    * [ ] `body`
    * [ ] `created_by_user_id`
    * [ ] `created_at`
    * [ ] `updated_at`
    * [ ] `deleted_at`
    * [ ] `metadata_json`
  * [ ] Entry visibility should be explicit:

    * [ ] `internal`
    * [ ] `client_visible`
  * [ ] Do not use the word `public` in code for client-visible ticket entries unless the entry is truly public internet visible.
  * [ ] Internal entries are visible only to internal users with appropriate ticket permissions.
  * [ ] Client-visible entries are visible to internal users and authorized client/external users who can access the ticket.
  * [ ] Ticket ledger entries should never replace audit logging.

* [ ] Define first ticket entry types.

## Version 0.40.0 - Project Tools expansion & Database extraction layer for use with SQLite or PostGRES

Now that we have the base layer of a complete project management tool, we can begin expanding actual project management with milestones, dependencies, status reporting, budgeting, estimation, views, templates, etc.

Allowing the app to run on SQLite OR PostGRES makes it more flexible for self-hosted installs; I want the database layer to be able to handle either one, based on the settings/.env file

Below is a rough road map for all of the 0.40 branch, this is not finalized yet

- [ ] Add topics to GitHub for discovery

### Project Tools expansion

- [ ] Project Milestones/Phases/Deliverables
  - Milestones belong to a workspace and optionally a client/project
  - Tasks, notes, tickets, time entries, and files may eventually link to a milestone
  - Milestones should have a title, description, status, due date, sort order, and optional completion/completed date
  - This should not block basic tasks, but the data model should leave room for it

- [ ] Task dependencies/blockers
  - Allow one task to depend on another task
  - Show blocked tasks clearly
  - Prevent circular dependencies
  - Allow blocked-by relationships across the same project, and maybe later across projects
  - More formal task workflow, such as `backlog`, `ready`, `in_progress`, `waiting`, `blocked`, `in_review`, `approved`, `complete`, `canceled`, and `archived`, often with rules about which statuses can move to which next statuses.

- [ ] Project Status/Health
  - Project status: active, paused, completed, archived
  - Project heatlh: on_track, at_risk, blocked, waiting_on_client
  - Dashboard should eventually surface project health

- [ ] Project budgeting/estimation/actuals
  - should be optional for personal/family projects
  - [ ] Add estimated hours to projects
  - [ ] Add optional budgeted hours/dollars to projects
  - [ ] Compare estimated vs actual tracked time
  - [ ] Show budget/burn progress on project pages and dashboard
  - [ ] Allow reporting by client, project, milestone, tag, and date range

- [ ] List/Kanban/Calendar views
  - [ ] Add list view for tasks
  - [ ] Add Kanban board view for tasks grouped by status
  - [ ] Add calendar view for tasks with due dates

- [ ] Project/task templates
  - should have hard-coded, initial examples that can be used as well as saved templates
  - [ ] Add task templates
  - [ ] Add project templates
  - [ ] Allow project templates to create default milestones, tasks, notes, and checklists
  - [ ] Allow workspace-level templates first
  - [ ] Later: allow client-specific templates

- [ ] Task checklists (tasks can have sub-item checklists)
  - Checklist items belong to a task
  - Items can be checked/unchecked and sorted
    - sort by: due date, importance, etc.
